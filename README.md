### To edit contents:
1. edit `_config.yml`
2. edit html/md files (hint: `_layouts/default.html` is the base)
3. edit sass and run `grunt` (hint: Try [editing `scss/_stettings.scss`](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/using-sass.html))
4. edit `_include/nav.html` 


### Useful command:

Run grunt to compile css from sass by simply run 

`grunt`

from your terminal. It will launch watch. <code>control-c</code> to stop.

You need to have grunt installed. <a href="http://daigo.org/2013/11/installing-npm-on-mavericks-macbook-pro/">This blog post</a> may be useful if you are like me and running Mac OS X.

To run jekyll locally, run 

`bundle exec jekyll serve --watch`

Your website should be viewable by going to [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/)

If you want to make sure foundation is up to date, try 

`foundation update`

(requires bower)
